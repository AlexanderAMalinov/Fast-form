# Fast-forms

Fast-forms - cli application, allow you make form without coding and using any libraries.
This application similar to Google Forms, but app was predominantly made for developers.
In my opinion, this app will be very useful for collect information from user for further
generate configuration file or other use.

## Ð¡haracteristic

Result of using Fast-forms - JS file, which can be executed by NodeJS.  
App building on "inquirer" npm package and it determine character of resulted JS file.

!!! For correct execute resulted file need installed (locally) 'inquirer' package.


## Installing

if you don`t have inquirer in your project:
```
npm install inquirer
```
directly install:
```
npm install fast-forms
```
